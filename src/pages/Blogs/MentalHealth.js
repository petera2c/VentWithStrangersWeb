        <p className="mb8">
          When we talk about something, it can make it feel more real. There is
          reluctance and fear associated with talking about mental health due to
          past stigmas and judgements surrounding many mental health conditions.
          When we talk about mental health we create a tangible thing that can
          be looked at and treated in the same way that a broken leg or illness
          can be treated. When we stay silent and we try to ignore the problem,
          it doesn’t go away it only gets worse - much like a broken leg or
          illness.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p className="mb8">
          Talking about mental health is important and it is time to see mental
          health as part of our overall health. A good diet, exercise and
          regular doctor visits are a necessity for our physical health as well
          as for our mental health.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb8">What does talking about it do?</h4>
        <p className="mb8">
          Simply talking about mental health may not seem like it will do much.
          If we don’t know about the benefits of talking about it we may instead
          fixate on the fear of judgement that talking about mental health may
          bring. But there are many benefits to talking about mental health both
          for the individual and for society as a collective.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb8">Removes the stigma</h4>
        <p className="mb8">
          In both Canada and the USA, approximately 1 in 5 individuals will deal
          with mental health in any given year. Yet there is still a reluctance
          to seek help or talk about mental health issues. A&nbsp;

          in 2015, 57% of those surveyed said that they had seen an improvement
          in the attitudes towards mental health in just the past 5 years. We
          are seeing positive growth and understanding when it comes to
          society’s outlook on mental health.&nbsp;

        <h4 className="mb8">Promotes treatment and education</h4>
        <p className="mb8">
          Talking about mental health removes the untrue and harmful stigmas
          associated with mental health conditions. The more we talk about
          something the more normalized it becomes in society thus creating a
          safer, more normalized action to take. Talking about mental health
          also helps to educate the listener and lessen judgement associated
          with the fear and stigma surrounding mental health conditions.&nbsp;

        <h4 className="mb8">How to talk about mental health</h4>
        <p className="mb8">
          Understanding the importance of talking about mental health is just
          half the battle. The big battle is taking that step to reach out and
          talk. So how can you take that first step?

          You are not alone, many people struggle with mental health in their
          life. 1 in 2 Canadian adults will have had some form of mental health
          problems in their life. You will experience a great sense of relief
          once you do tell someone who will listen without judgement. The more
          we talk about mental health the less judgement there is because mental
          health is a part of your overall health and talking about it the
          healthy thing to do.
        </p>
        <p className="mb8">
          If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, such as
          anxiety or depression, reach out on a supportive platform like&nbsp;
